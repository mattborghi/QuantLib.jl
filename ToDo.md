# ToDo

Gather a list of resources found for developing a Julia Package for Day Count Conventions

## Packages

* [QuantLib.jl](https://github.com/mattborghi/QuantLib.jl): best coded Julia-based package I found.
* [QuantLib c++](https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib/blob/master/Examples/Bonds/Bonds.cpp) implementation with examples.
* [DayCounts.jl](https://github.com/JuliaFinance/DayCounts.jl): it's well documented with links to calculations.
*	[FinancialMarkets.jl](https://github.com/imanuelcostigan/FinancialMarkets.jl).
* [BusinessDays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaFinance/BusinessDays.jl): good tool for business days calculations. Frequently updated.

## Info

* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_count_convention).
* [DeltaQuants](http://www.deltaquants.com/day-count-conventions).
* [Library](http://www.deltaquants.com/schedules-and-business-calendar) with utility functions, also in DeltaQuants.
